# Golden Mini Music Player

This is a lightweight HTML/CSS/JS music player demo with a golden theme. 
Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js

How to use:
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (modern browsers recommended).
3. The player uses external audio/image links; for Google Drive or Dropbox links, the player will try to normalize them into direct links automatically.

Notes:
- Tailwind is pulled via CDN. If you prefer to include Tailwind locally, replace the @import in styles.css.
- If hosting audio from Google Drive, make sure the file is shareable publicly.
